## Deploy Front-End on IC（Internet Computer）
The main difference when choosing **IC** deployment is that you need to provide an **IC** account and add a configuration file

After the account is successfully created, you still need to add a configuration file. Hamster can also add file configuration for you with one click. You can also customize the file in the options.

When your IC account balance is insufficient to pay for the deployment of IC services, Hamster will prompt that one-click deployment failed.  
At this point, you can click the **View FrontEnd** button to go to the project details page to view the reason for the failure.
