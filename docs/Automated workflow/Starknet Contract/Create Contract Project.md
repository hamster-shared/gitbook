- ERC1155 - Multi-token standard contract template, which can be used to issue different types of tokens.
- ERC20 - Fungible token standard contract template, which can be used to issue the same type of interchangeable tokens.

We warmly welcome community developers to propose more contract template needs or share high-quality contract templates. Let's work together to promote the development of the Starknet ecosystem.
