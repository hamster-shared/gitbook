All contract code files with problems in the project will be displayed in this area. You can optimize and improve the smart contract based on the AI Analysis report.

## Next,...
Hamster has always put the security of Starknet smart contracts first. 

We currently use AI technology to fully detect potential security vulnerabilities in contracts. In the future, we will also introduce top audit companies and open source tools in the industry to fully guarantee security. 

Users can safely develop and call Starknet smart contracts on Hamster. We will do our best to ensure that every line of code can stand security audits.
