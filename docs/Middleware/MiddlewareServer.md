# Middleware Server

## RPC
Web3 development is inseparable from the support of blockchain nodes, and building and maintaining nodes requires a lot of cost and effort. In order to enable developers to obtain efficient and stable node services, Miwago provides RPC services to meet the development needs of developers for various ecological projects .

## Oracle
The Oracle is the messenger for the interaction between the blockchain and the real world data. It is an indispensable infrastructure for the web3 ecology, and its development plays a vital role in the prosperity of the web3 ecology. In order to allow developers to quickly access more suitable oracle services with zero code or low code, the Hamster platform aggregates various oracle solution middleware on the market.
### Hamslink
Chainlink Functions is a web3 serverless development platform that allows you to fetchdata from any API and perform custom computations on Chainlink's highly secure andreliable network. However, Chainlink Functions operations are relatively complex, the visual interface is insufficient, and a certain level of coding ability is required. To simplify Chainlink Functions operations and allow more developers to easily access Chainlink Functions services, Hamster has integrated and developed a Chainlink Functions servicemiddleware.

## Storage
The concept of web3 is decentralization, and data sovereignty belongs to users. Decentralized storage solutions are the requirements of web3 users, and will eventually become the best choice for web3 developers. In order to allow web3 developers to quickly and cost-effectively access suitable decentralized solutions, Hamster The platform aggregates various decentralized solutions on the market.
### Filecoin
Filecoin is a decentralized storage network. Through an open and autonomous responsiblestorage network, it provides users with secure, private and affordable decentralized datastorage solutions. It has strong technical advantages and broad application prospects.
### BNB Greenfield
BNB Greenfield is a decentralized storage platform. As a sidechain of BSC, it aims toestablish a new data economy and facilitate the improvement and development of web3infrastructure. It has unique designs and advantages in semantics, redundant backups,file repair, storage costs, smart contracts, data access control, etc.
### CESS
CESS is a decentralized cloud storage network for online data storage and real-timesharing. By providing smart contracts, DeOSS services and tools, CESS can easily accessdApps, enabling both enterprise and individual users to easily achieve secure data storage, sharing and transactions.

## Graph
Data sharing on the blockchain can be queried and obtained by everyone, but directly accessing the target data on the blockchain usually requires a lot of energy and cost for developers, which is not advisable for development work. In order to allow developers to obtain and use data on the chain more friendly, Miwago integrates various excellent data solutions on the market.
### SubQuery
SubQuery is an Open, Flexible, Fast and Universal data indexing frameworkfor web3.Not only can you obtain stable and efficient multi-chain data indexing services through SubQuery, but you can also quickly build your own data APIs.
### KNN3
KNN3 Network is a one-stop Web3 User-centric DataFi solution for d/Apps and smart contracts. KNN3 allows d/Apps & smart contracts to interact with cross-platform user-centric data in multiple algo-friendly ways.

## ZKP
As we all know, zero-knowledge proof can play a very important role in the expansion of Ethereum and data privacy, but its technical implementation is also very difficult. Hamster will cooperate with excellent ZKP teams to popularize ZKP technology, and at the same time reduce the cost of using ZKP technology for developers as much as possible.

## Others
Hamster will also provide developers with web3 infrastructure middleware such as wallets and DIDs.
### Hamswallet
Hamwallet is an aggregated wallet framework that provides web3 developers with fast integration of multi-wallet connections and on-chain data management services. Hamwallet helps developers quickly build and scale web3 projects through rich wallet integration, visual interfaces and flexible configurations.
### GoPlus Security
GoPlus provides open, unlicensed, user-driven security services and is committed to buildingthe "security infrastructure" of web3. GoPlus ensures a safer web3 ecosystem by building a secure data infrastructure and security service platform.
### Trusta
Trusta matches on-chain assets with suitable users. Using AI-driven witch attack prevention,knowledge graph enhanced analysis and user positioning, Trusta plays an important role in scenarios such as securing transactions and logins, and formulating airdrop strategies.
