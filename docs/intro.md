# Overview

## What is Hamster?

Hamster is a non threshold node deployment platform in the Web3 world.

The hamster project starts from providing full stack hosting for blockchain application services as a usage scenario of shared computing services. Based on decentralized computing power sharing and automation technology, non-technical users can join the project and become a node of the project with one click, which is safe, reliable, and operation and maintenance free, greatly reducing the threshold of entering the blockchain world. The underlying chain of hamster is a decentralized computing network. lts purpose is to provide users with a cost-effective computing server. lt is a decentralized computing resource leasing platform, which can lease idle computing resources. At present, many cloud computing service providers provide cloud computing services, but with the expansion of services, the price of cloud computing services has gradually stabilized and remained high. The goal of our products is to use the idle computing resources in people's hands in a decentralized manner, so that users in need can use computing services in a low-cost manner. So: as long as you want to join Web3, you can become a node of any blockchain hot project and gain profits through hamster with one click; As long as you have a computer,as long as you have electricity and networks, you can provide computing power for many blockchain projects and earn profits through hamster.
